------------

This is a flash application that 
allows "streaming" of chiptune music
from URLs in-browser. Note that it's
not actual streaming. In fact the
entire file is downloaded, but thanks
to the ridiculously small size of
old tracker music the delay is 
meaningless. Originally built as an
alternative to ModArchive's JMOD player.
